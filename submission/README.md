# CS 470, Proj 2, Group 8: Binomial Heap, Skip List

These animations for _Red Black Tree_, _Skip List_, and _Binomial Heap_ are all written in python3, so if you haven't installed python yet, please do so [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). _Red Black Tree_ (rbtree_anim.ipynb) and _Skip List_ (skiplist_anim.ipynb) both run in Jupyter, so the extra installation instructions are down below. Either way, ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` must be run.

## Installation Instructions for _Red Black Tree_ and _Skip List_ animations

Instead of running ```python3 -m pip install algviz``` in the graphviz instructions below, run ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

Follow the [installation instructions](https://algviz.com/en/installation.html) in order to run red black tree animation (rbtree_implementation.ipynb), as well as skip list animation (skiplist_anim.ipynb).

## Binomial Heap Animation
This animation of binomial heap teaches the concepts of a binomial heap. There are 12 nodes inserted automatically, pre-chosen to show basics, and then two delete-min operations.
